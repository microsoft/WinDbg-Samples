# TTD live recorder API sample

This is a sample demonstrating how a program can use TTD's live recording API to record portions of itself.

## Getting Started

A copy of TTD's recorder binaries is needed in order to build and run this sample.
There are general instructions describing how to obtain the binaries documented in [How to download and install the TTD.exe command line utility (Offline method)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debuggercmds/time-travel-debugging-ttd-exe-command-line-util#how-to-download-and-install-the-ttdexe-command-line-utility-offline-method)

For the purposes of this sample, you can just run the provided script `.\Get-Ttd` from a command or powershell window.
This script downloads the most current binaries into a TTDDownload subdirectory.

After that is done, open LiveRecorderApiSample.sln in Visual Studio 2022 16.8 or newer and build an appropriate configuration with F5. The sample builds and works for x64, x86 and ARM64.

## Dependencies

Apart from TTD's binaries, this sample requires the [`Microsoft.TimeTravelDebugging.Apis` NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.TimeTravelDebugging.Apis) that provides the API.
This is downloaded automatically from the feed at https://nuget.org if it's configured in Visual Studio.


The API documentation can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/WinDbg-Samples/tree/master/TTD/docs

## Running the sample

When the sample is run, it will ask for the administrator pin or password because TTD requires admin privileges in order to record.
Note that the sample itself will not run as admin, only TTD's command-line tool TTD.exe as invoked by the sample.

After the admin request is granted the sample will run and record several portions of itself. The output will look like this:

```
Trace file: X:\repos\Microsoft\WinDbg-Samples\TTD\LiveRecorderApiSample\out\x64-Debug\LiveRecorderApiSample01.run
All done!
```

This provides the full path to the trace file that was recorded. This trace file can then be loaded into [WinDbg](https://aka.ms/WinDbg), where it will show like this:
